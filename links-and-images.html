        Paragraphs are an example of block elements because, by default, they take up the entire width of the web page and add space at the
        top and bottom of the element.
    -->
    <p>This web page shows the difference between block and inline elements!</p>
    <!--
        Anchors are an example of inline elemets because, by default, they only take up the space that they need to.

        We showed the difference between block and inline elements using Developer Tools, which we accessed using Ctrl+Shift+I. Developer Tools is helpful to show you the
        exact code that is used to display a specific element and can show you the width, height, and spacing around the element.

<!-- This is an example of an image tag.
The src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
The src attribute can be an Internet location (i.e. , https://www.google.com...),
but the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the images you use on your website.-->
